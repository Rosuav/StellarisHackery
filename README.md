Stellaris Hackery
=================

General hackery and tinkering. This mod will not be gameplay-balanced or
necessarily even fun; its purpose is to be an exploration platform, and any
actually-viable mod ideas will be spun off into their own mods.

Installation:

Clone this repo into ~/.local/share/Paradox Interactive/Stellaris/mod (create
that directory if necessary), copy mod/Hackery/descriptor.mod into a new file
mod/Hackery.mod, and add this line at the bottom:

path="mod/Hackery"
